Crust cooling function depends on:
1. Q_{imp} (*)
2. Singlet neutron superfluidity
3. EOS
4. T_{core}
5. shallow heating (depth and amount)
6. Light elements in envelope/ocean
7. Accretion rate history
8. How and when the accretion outburst ended
9. The properties of the pasta (*)

(*) = possibly not independent of the others
